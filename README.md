# Meteor-React-Ionic Basic Template

This template is the absolute bare minimum you need to get started with the Meteor-React-Ionic stack to build hybrid mobile apps. Your app will run and you will have three functioning routes. Other than that, the app doesn't do anything. You'll have to add that functionality yourself.

In the future, I intend to create other, modular repos that build on this template. That functionality would include: passing through data with Mongo.Collections, user accounts, chat functionality, Cordova integration, animations and transitions, and a Tinder interface.
